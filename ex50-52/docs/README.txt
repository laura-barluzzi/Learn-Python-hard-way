This is the final exercise of the book Learn Python the Hard Way and it is a web-based game.

Before running the code from the terminal, make sure to do the following: 

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
    
On Windows PowerShell type: 

    $env:PYTHONPATH = "$env: PYTHONPATH;."
    
------------------------------------------------------------

After this you run the code from inside the project directory typing: 

    python bin/app.py
    
-----------------------------------------------------------

After running it, the local host url shows up and you copy-paste it to the browser for playing it

Enjoy!
